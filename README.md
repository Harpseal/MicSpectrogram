# MicSpectrogram

This is a sample android app which visualizes mic waveform in pitch frequency scale by using kissFFT.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is provide a diffence way that not only hear sounds but alse see sounds. The spectrogram is visulized in the pitch frequency scale because pitch is the key relationship between music and mathematics. Users can use this app to tune musical instruments(ex.guitar) or improve the singing tone. 

Converting waveform to frequency, FFT is the most important invention in the human history. But unfortunately, the results of FFT are still too noisy in complex sounds. Human can easily identify different sound from different instruments or different person by hearing, but it is difficult by seeing the FFT results. Maybe someday human can find a better way to visualize what we hear, but now the clean sound input is the only way to get a clean result.
